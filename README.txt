This application uses keyboard shortcuts to simplify the live chat process with Audible.

To begin the chat, load the Audible web page at https://www.audible.com/amazon-chat

While on the Audible page, the following keyboard shortcuts are enabled:
CTRL + J: Fill out the live chat prompts. A window will pop up asking for the full information in this format: "FIRSTNAME LASTNAME EMAIL ADDRESS". Paste the information into that box and press ENTER. The script will fill out the prompt based on that information.

There are also chat-replacements, listed as follows. Type the keyword and then press space to fill out the full replacement text.
